== Purpose

After my complaining about the non-fresh biscuit I brought from grocery store in the neighbourhood, I come across endless news and complains from other people via social network tools. So I am considering making a tool to monitor all the products ( for the momnent foods only) I am using or will use. It really looks ridiculous to rely on the government to carry out all the regulations.

The project also serves as a personal study for how the world(actually a small environment) works, from this web application developing to the all the rules and regulation even opinions underlie. 

== Targets
* Personal interest oriented, monitor personal stuff first
* LBS service to get an idea of the price distribution, also need  volunteers share their billings.
* OCR tool on mobile phone to recognize the billing paper.
* If possible, serve as a tool for maths study
